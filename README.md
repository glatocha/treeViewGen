This project was made for fast and easy tree graphs creation. The goal was that it is fast, simple and easy to share with others.

Due to the browser based solution, this project does not have access to the user file system. Therefore easy and fast saving is not possible (and not safe). Project uses browser local storage for storing the data.
This is faster than downloading files after every modification. I would strongly recomend downloading the project file after every session.

The project is fully open source, so feel free to copy, modify and use as you please. If you, however, want to publish it somewhere, please mainain the link to the original author's repository.
